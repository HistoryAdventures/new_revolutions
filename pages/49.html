                    The Berlin Conference of 1884 marked a key moment in the push for taking over
                    massive swaths of the African content, but annexing portions of Africa was not new
                    to European powers in the nineteenth century. On the contrary, history reveals that
                    the Spanish and Portuguese were already exploring the African coast as early as the
                    sixteenth century, with French forces arriving in the subsequent century.

                    Their central goal was to expand their own national presence under the pretext of
                    imperialism – that is, the desire to further one’s nation by taking over new
                    territories and “reforming” them to a European way of life – but they also saw
                    Africa as an untapped array of natural resources that could support the rampant wave
                    of industrialization that was sweeping Europe. In addition to the resources
                    necessary for industry, Africa also offered a plethora of precious materials such as
                    ivory. As a result, during the 19th century an
                    increasing number of European began to stake claims to areas of the African coast.

                                                February 1885, was the Berlin Act, which aimed to abolish
                                                slavery and initiate free trade throughout the region of
                                                Congo; it also subdivided the continent into regions that
                                                European powers could lay claim to legally. It was also the
