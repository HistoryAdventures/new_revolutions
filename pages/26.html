                    Relations between the settlers and the natives over the course of the first half
                    century after the arrival of the First Fleet was marked by escalating tensions and
                    increasing violence. As the settlers spread out of the original colonies, more land
                    was grabbed, speeding up the deterioration in relations between the two groups.

                    The British had first hoped to ingratiate themselves with the natives and assimilate
                    them into the British culture (which they believed to be superior). The aim was to
                    use them to help work the newly-acquired land, despite the nomadic traditions of the
                    aborigines, as well as using them as translators to speed-up cooperation and
                    communication. Increasingly violent clashes curtailed these efforts.
