                                                        was economic; it was designed to remove the strictures
                                                        imposed on trade by the Canton system. Four new “treaty
                                                        ports” were opened up, including Shanghai. Fixed tariffs in
                                                        these ports were also established. Alongside these economic
                                                        benefits to the British, the British demanded a payment of
                                                        six million dollars in recompense for the opium that had by
                                                        confiscated by Lin Zexu in 1839. The treaty also established
                                                        the cession of Hong Kong from China to Britain. The island
                                                        now became a crown colony.

                                                        The articles of the treaty effectively confirmed the
                                                        military superiority of the European imperialists over the
                                                        Chinese and facilitated their continued economic
                                                        exploitation. It is easy to understand why this treaty was
                                                        the first of what the Chinese would later call the “Unequal
                                                        Treaties”.

                                                        (ca.1830). The Canton system was an attempt by the Chinese
                                                        to control trade with Europe by directing all external trade
                                                        to the port of Canton. This is evident from this image where
                                                        you can see the array of western flags billowing over the

                                                        end of the First Opium War (1757 – 1842), the Canton System
                                                        is the name given to the Chinese system for attempting to
                                                        control imports. All trade was centered on the southern port
                                                        city of Canton (modern Guangzhou), and this was done to
                                                        counter the belief that the country was under threat from

                                                        resistance to this policy ultimately led to the First Opium
