                    &nbsp;&nbsp;More and more of these white folk arrive with every ship.
                    Some come in chains while others come with weapons. Some come with books and lessons to
                    change who we are, but they all come to take what is not theirs. They call our beautiful bay
                    Botany, a word that means nothing to us or our ancestors. They destroy our land, burning
                    trees and landscape to make way for larger houses or more numerous ones. Large gardens are
                    planted with rows and rows of food; more than any man could ever eat! Now carrots lie in our
                    sacred lands, the places where we lay our dead to rest or honor births.
                    The sweet, starchy vegetable tastes like ashes in our mouths.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;I know that I will be the last of my generation to remember how things were.
                    As these whites drive us further into the bush, I realize that we are dying just as the land
                    is. Perhaps that is why we are bound to do what we do.
                    Perhaps we have displeased the gods with our lack of sacrifice for the land, to protect it
                    from these intruders.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what we will do, as our children, our elderly, and even some or
                    our young men are perishing
                    from these illnesses. A cough rattles my chest even now and I worry: is it the sickness from
                    the white men?
                    Will I, too, find myself among my people sick and helpless, a young man who is wasting away
                    before them?
