                            From out of the early modern period, we now enter a period characterized by the
                            difficult
                            questions that came to the forefront of the people who lived through an era of
                            incredible
                            change.<br> As traditional societies gave way to more
                            dynamic cultures, with the kingdoms of Europe being increasingly replaced by Empires
                            with a
                            truly global focus, the people caught up in this expansion sought to explain their place
                            in
                            this new world. They would ask the questions
                            that, at their heart, challenged the traditional forms of authority in society:
                            Employer,
                            King, and God
