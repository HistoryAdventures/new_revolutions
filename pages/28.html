                                            The first British colonists soon realized how harsh and
                                            unforgiving the Australian land could be. The land itself
                                            was
                                            hot, arid, and uncompromising, meaning that it was not ideal
                                            as
                                            ideal for agriculture as the settlers had first been led to
                                            believe. Worse still, the country lacked fauna that could be
                                            domesticated for farming; try as you might, farming
                                            kangaroos
                                            will never be as profitable as farming cows or sheep!
